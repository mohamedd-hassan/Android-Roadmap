# Android-Roadmap
Why choose Android Development? over 3 billion Android devices all over the world including: ( ðŸ“± Smartphones, ðŸ“º TVs, âŒš Smartwatches, ðŸš— Cars and more) in the hands of 2.5 billion users, it has become essential for companies to develop Android apps for their services.   
<br>
In this roadmap we will guide you on your journey to become a professional Android Developer.   

## Beginner Level
In this level we will teach you the fundementals of making an Android app. We won't dive deep into Android Components but don't let that fool you, we will still be able to create powerful apps.

### Kotlin Fundamentals
Why Kotlin? It is strongly recommended by Google and it has been the official language for Android and more and more companies are migrating their code bases to Kotlin.    
<br>
Does that mean Java is not important? Of course not, as an developer you need to be comfortable with both as many companies still use Java and a lot useful code samples and documentation still uses it, but we will learn it later as not to get overwhelmed.   
<br>
Here are some sources to start learning Kotlin
- [Kotlin Basics Arabic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXjbGq0ERjFriC0igmYE9qUwwJfEHGJ8H)   
- [Kotlin Basics English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsrQV0wXh2E&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRSQikwhtoApYs9ij_Hc5Z9)

Once you are comfortable with the syntax you can move on to the next topic.

### Basics of XML

You Don't have to be an XML expert but get comfortable desiging UI using it

For the next topics I recommend learning by applying to a project   
recommendedations 

  - [Google Code Labs](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course)
  - [Clean Architecure Note App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YPXv7xKh2w&t=7490s)

  Don't worry if you feel like you can't keep up, you'll get used to these topics in the future.
- ViewModel
- Room
- Coroutines

## Intermediate Level

### Permission Handling
### Retrofit/Ktor
### XML with Compose
### Jetpack Datastore/SharedPreference
### Dependency Injection
### Sensors
### Content Provider
### Workmanager
### Foreground Sevices

## Advanced Level
Here in the advanced level you will need to learn and research topics more on your own, it will help you increase your searching skills and help you find and learn more topics on your own in the future

### App Architecture
App Architecure is very important to maintain a readable and scaleable code base, you can start learning about it here

[App Architecure](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)

### Multi-Module App Development
The next step modularity, here you will learn what modules are and why and if you should use this approach depending on your codebase

[Modularity](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization)


### Canvas
Create custom beautiful shapes and composable using the Canvas

[Canvas Overview](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/graphics/draw/overview)


### Gesture Handling
Handle gestures ranging from holding and swiping to more advanced pointer inputs

[Understand Gestures](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/pointer-input/understand-gestures?hl=en)


### Stylus Detection And Palm Rejection
Detect stylus and info about it like tilt, orientation, and pressure and reject palm input to create the perfect drawing app

[Advanced Stylus Features](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/stylus-input/advanced-stylus-features?hl=en)

### AGSL (Android Graphics Shader Langauge)
Allows you to create and render beautiful RuntimeShaders in either canvas in compose or filter View content

[AGSL](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/agsl)


### Unit Testing

No code is without fault, that's why its so important to learn unit testing to make sure your code works as intended
